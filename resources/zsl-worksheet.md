# Zoology & Materials: Animal Survival Toolkit

## Overview
This activity, designed in partnership with ZSL (Zoological Society of London), explores how animals use materials from their environment to survive. By linking to the iron(II) sulfide demonstration, pupils see that materials can be both natural and human‑made, and that their properties determine how they are used.

## Learning Objectives
After completing this worksheet, pupils will be able to:
- Identify at least three different materials used by animals (e.g., shells, teeth, feathers, fur).
- Explain how the properties of a material help an animal survive (e.g., hardness for protection, flexibility for movement).
- Compare natural materials with those made in the laboratory (e.g., iron sulfide vs. animal teeth).
- Recognise that humans can learn from animal materials to design new products (biomimetics).

## Links to the Curriculum
- **KS2 Science** (Living things and their habitats, Evolution and inheritance): Adaptation, variation, and classification.
- **KS3 Biology** (Structure and function of living organisms): Skeletal and muscular systems; material cycling in ecosystems.
- **Cross‑curricular** (Design and technology): Biomimicry, properties of materials.

## Materials Needed
- Printed copies of this worksheet.
- Access to the internet or books about animals (optional).
- Access to a zoo or wildlife park (optional – can be used as a follow‑up visit).
- A small collection of natural materials (e.g., a seashell, a feather, a piece of fur/fabric).

## Activity 1: Animal Materials Hunt
1. **Watch** the short ZSL video “Animal Superpowers” (if available) or look at the images provided.
2. **In groups**, list as many animals as you can think of that use special materials for survival. For example:
   - A tortoise uses its hard shell (made of bone and keratin) for protection.
   - A beaver uses its sharp teeth (enamel, the hardest biological material) to cut wood.
   - A spider uses silk (stronger than steel, relative to its weight) to build a web.
   - A bird uses lightweight, hollow bones for flight.
3. **Discuss** why each material is useful. What property does it have? (hard, flexible, strong, light, etc.)

## Activity 2: Compare with Laboratory Materials
1. Recall the iron(II) sulfide demonstration. The product was a black, non‑magnetic solid.
2. **Compare** the properties of iron(II) sulfide with those of animal materials:
   | Material          | Property             | How it helps the animal / human |
   |-------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------|
   | Iron(II) sulfide  | Hard, brittle        | Used in industry (e.g., pigments) |
   | Tortoise shell    | Hard, tough          | Protection from predators       |
   | Beaver teeth      | Hard, sharp          | Cutting wood for dams           |
   | Spider silk       | Flexible, very strong | Catching prey                    |
3. **Think** – Could we make a material in the lab that copies one of these animal materials? (e.g., scientists have made synthetic spider silk for medical stitches.)

## Activity 3: Design Your Own “Super‑Animal”
1. Imagine you are creating a new animal that lives in a particular habitat (e.g., a desert, a rainforest, a city).
2. **Choose** two materials that your animal uses to survive. They could be natural (like a shell) or human‑made (like a metal).
3. **Draw** a picture of your animal and label the materials it uses.
4. **Explain** why you chose those materials – what properties do they have, and how do they help your animal survive?

## Follow‑up Discussion
- How do zoos and wildlife parks help us learn about animal materials? (E.g., by watching animals use their materials in real life.)
- What can humans learn from animal materials? (Biomimicry examples: Velcro inspired by burrs, bullet‑train shape inspired by kingfisher’s beak.)
- Why is it important to protect animals and their habitats? (If we lose an animal, we might lose the chance to study its amazing materials.)

## Extension for Older Students
- Research how animal teeth are made of hydroxyapatite (a calcium phosphate mineral) and how this is similar to the minerals we make in the lab.
- Investigate how some animals use magnetic materials for navigation (e.g., magnetite in pigeons’ beaks). Link to the magnetism test in the iron(II) sulfide demonstration.

## ZSL Partnership Note
This worksheet has been developed in collaboration with ZSL’s education team. For more resources, visit [zsl.org/education](https://www.zsl.org/education). A visit to ZSL London Zoo or Whipsnade Zoo provides an excellent opportunity to see these materials in action.
