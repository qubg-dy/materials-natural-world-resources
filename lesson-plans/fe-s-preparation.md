# Lesson Plan: Preparation of Iron(II) Sulfide

## Overview
This practical demonstration shows the reaction between iron and sulfur to form iron(II) sulfide, a classic example of a synthesis reaction. It illustrates how new materials with different properties can be formed from elements, linking to the broader theme of “materials in the natural world”.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of the lesson, students will be able to:
- Describe the reaction between iron and sulfur as a synthesis reaction.
- Explain that the product (iron(II) sulfide) has different properties from the reactants.
- Recognise that metal sulfides occur naturally (e.g., pyrite) and can be formed in the laboratory.
- Follow a safe practical procedure and identify key safety hazards.

## Links to the Curriculum
- **KS3 Chemistry** (Materials): Reactivity of metals, chemical reactions, properties of materials.
- **KS2 Science** (Properties of materials): Compare and group materials based on their properties; recognise that some materials occur naturally, others are manufactured.
- **Cross‑phase link**: The demonstration can be adapted for primary pupils by focusing on observable changes (colour, magnetism) and the idea that materials can be transformed.

## Resources Needed
- Iron filings (powdered iron) – 7 g
- Sulfur powder (flowers of sulfur) – 4 g
- Porcelain dish or heat‑proof mat
- Bunsen burner, tripod, gauze
- Tongs or crucible tongs
- Magnet (e.g., a strong neodymium magnet in a plastic bag)
- Spatula, weighing boat
- Safety goggles, heat‑resistant gloves
- Fume cupboard (recommended) or well‑ventilated room

## Safety
**HIGH RISK –** Hydrogen sulfide gas may be produced if excess sulfur is present. This gas is toxic and smells of rotten eggs.
- Carry out the reaction in a fume cupboard if possible.
- Wear safety goggles and gloves throughout.
- Do not inhale any fumes; ensure good ventilation.
- The dish becomes very hot – use tongs and allow sufficient cooling before handling.
- Wash hands after the practical.

## Method
### Preparation
1. Weigh out 7 g of iron filings and 4 g of sulfur powder (ratio ≈ 7:4 by mass).
2. Mix the two powders thoroughly on a piece of paper or in a weighing boat.

### Reaction
3. Transfer the mixture to a dry porcelain dish or onto a heat‑proof mat placed on a tripod and gauze.
4. Heat the mixture strongly with a Bunsen burner (roaring blue flame) for 5–8 minutes.
5. Observe the colour change from a grey‑yellow mix to a dull black solid.
6. Once the reaction appears complete (no more glowing or fuming), turn off the burner and allow the dish to cool completely.

### Testing the Product
7. When cold, gently break up the solid with a spatula.
8. Test the magnetic properties: bring a magnet close to the product (iron is magnetic, iron(II) sulfide is not). The product should not be attracted.
9. Optional: add a drop of dilute hydrochloric acid to a small sample – the characteristic rotten‑egg smell of hydrogen sulfide confirms the presence of sulfide ions.

## Common Pitfalls & Troubleshooting
- **Mixture not reacting** – Ensure the mixture is dry and finely powdered. Heat strongly enough; a gentle flame may not initiate the reaction.
- **Excess sulfur** – If too much sulfur is used, unreacted sulfur may burn, producing sulfur dioxide. Stick to the 7:4 ratio.
- **Incomplete reaction** – If the product is still magnetic, the reaction may not have gone to completion. Re‑heat the mixture for a further 2–3 minutes.
- **Safety** – If any smell of rotten eggs is noticed, stop heating and increase ventilation immediately.

## Differentiation
- **Support:** Provide a step‑by‑step pictorial guide. Focus on the observable changes (colour, magnetism) rather than the chemical equation.
- **Challenge:** Ask students to write the word equation and balanced chemical equation for the reaction. Discuss why the product is non‑magnetic (loss of metallic bonding).
- **Extension:** Research natural metal sulfides (pyrite, galena) and their uses. Compare the laboratory‑made product with naturally occurring minerals.

## Assessment Opportunities
- Observation of students’ practical skills (measuring, heating, safety awareness).
- Questions during the demonstration: “What do you notice about the colour before and after heating?” “Why is the product no longer magnetic?”
- Written task: Produce a simple risk assessment for the practical.

## Follow‑up Activities
- Link to the “Animal Materials” activity (ZSL worksheet) – discuss how animals use hard materials (shells, teeth) that often contain mineral compounds similar to those made in the lab.
- Visit to a zoo or natural history museum to observe real‑world examples of materials used by animals.
