# Materials in the Natural World - Teaching Resource Pack

## Purpose
This project creates a cohesive, cross‑phase science teaching resource pack that bridges secondary chemistry, primary science, and zoology. The pack is designed to help teachers deliver engaging, practical lessons that link the classic chemistry demonstration of iron(II) sulfide preparation with the UK primary science curriculum’s focus on materials and their properties, enriched by real‑world examples from the animal kingdom (inspired by the Zoological Society of London).

## Target Audience
- Primary school teachers (Key Stage 1 & 2) looking to strengthen their science teaching with clear curriculum links.
- Secondary science teachers wanting to create cross‑curricular connections and practical demonstrations that resonate with younger learners.
- Educators planning visits to zoos or wildlife parks who wish to enhance the experience with pre‑ and post‑visit activities.

## Proposed Structure
The resource pack is organised into three core components:

1. **Lesson Plans**
   - `lesson-plans/fe-s-preparation.md` – A detailed, classroom‑ready guide for the preparation of iron(II) sulfide, including safety notes, common pitfalls, and suggested questioning.

2. **Curriculum Mapping**
   - `curriculum-mapping.md` – A document that explicitly links the concepts covered in the pack to the UK primary science curriculum (2014 onwards), highlighting progression across year groups.

3. **Activities & Worksheets**
   - `activities/zsl-animal-materials.md` – A hands‑on activity for use before or after a trip to ZSL (or any zoo), focusing on how animals use different materials (shells, fur, scales, etc.) for survival.

## How to Use This Repository
- Each component is developed in its own feature branch and merged via pull requests, mimicking a professional action‑research cycle.
- Issues track the development tasks, and releases provide versioned, stable snapshots of the complete pack.
- Teachers can download the latest release (`v1.0` or later) to obtain a ready‑to‑use set of resources.

## Contributing
Feedback, suggestions, and improvements are welcome. Please open an issue or submit a pull request if you have ideas for extending the pack or adapting it for different educational contexts.
